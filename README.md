<h2>Virtual Try-on Module</h2><hr />

It does what it says. It segments a human image(input) based on its features, and then it pastes the clothing(preferably with a plane background) input image on the figure and outputs that new picture of the person wearing the input clothing.
I used some pre-trained models that were on Huggingface and just added them in sequence, there are many VirtualTry-on models on the internet and I took those as references and made some changes to make them fit with the requirements of the project. 
It was part of a bigger project at IIT-Guwahati.
It was fun learning about different libraries and the amazing models that people have already built, and it's out there for free.
